# ZSOXIAL SOCIAL MEADIA BACKEND REST API
Zsoxial Social Media Backend Rest API is a sophisticated backend solution tailored for Social
Media applications. Built using Golang and the Gin web framework, it employs a Microservice
architecture with gRPC for seamless communication. This API excels in routing and processing
HTTP requests, meticulously adhering to industry-leading practices in code architecture and
dependency management. It offers a robust foundation for scalable and efficient Social Media
platforms.

## Key Features
- **Microservice Architecture**: Modular architecture promoting scalability and resilience
through loosely coupled services communicating via lightweight protocols.
- **Clean Code Architecture**: Structured, readable codebase following SOLID principles,
enhancing maintainability, and facilitating future development and updates.
Dependency Injection: Decoupling components by injecting dependencies, promoting
flexibility, testability, and easier code maintenance.
- **Database (Postgres and MongoDB)**: Utilizing Postgres for structured data and MongoDB for
flexibility in handling unstructured data, catering to diverse data requirements.
- **AWS Integration (S3)**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS S3 for scalable, secure, and reliable
cloud-based storage solutions, ensuring robust data management capabilities.
-**Social Media Features**: Incorporates essential functionalities like messaging, video calls,
notifications, posts, stories, facilitating engaging user interactions and content sharing.
-**Real-time Processing (Kafka, Websocket)**: Enables real-time data processing using Kafka for
distributed event streaming and Websocket for bidirectional communication, ensuring
timely updates and interactions.
-**Real-time Communication (WebRTC)**: Employs WebRTC for efficient peer-to-peer
communication, enabling high-quality, real-time audio/video calls and data sharing.
-**Caching (Redis)**: Utilizes Redis for fast, in-memory caching, enhancing performance by
storing frequently accessed data and reducing database load.
-**Containerization and Orchestration**: Implements containerization using Docker for
consistent deployment environments and orchestration with Kubernetes for efficient
management and scaling of containerized applications.
